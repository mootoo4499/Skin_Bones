# Screenplay Format Guidelines

*Based on [StudioBinder's Complete Screenplay Format Guide](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/brilliant-script-screenplay-format/#Extensions-Screenplay-Format)*

## What is a Screenplay?

A **movie script or screenplay** is the blueprint for any feature film, TV show or video game. Scripts include character actions, dialogue and movement as well as stage direction. Movie script format has a unique set of industry standard rules, which are slightly different than the script writing format used in a shooting script.

### Key Facts:
- Screenplays are typically 90-110 pages in length
- Format helps determine run time, schedule & budget
- One page of film script equals roughly one minute of screen time

## Essential Screenplay Elements

### 1. Sluglines (Scene Headings)

Sluglines tell the reader where the action is happening. Format: `INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME`

**Examples:**
```
INT. MORT'S KITCHEN - DAY #1#
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT #2#
INT./EXT. MOVING CAR - CONTINUOUS #3#
```

**Rules:**
- Always in ALL CAPS
- Start with INT. (interior) or EXT. (exterior)
- Add location, then time of day
- Use "CONTINUOUS" when scene flows directly from previous
- Use "MOMENTS LATER" for brief time gaps

### 2. Action Lines

Action lines describe what the audience will see and hear (everything except dialogue).

**Format:**
- Present tense, third person
- Visually descriptive
- Clear and readable
- "Just the facts" approach

**Capitalization Rules:**
- Character names (first appearance only)
- Screenplay transitions
- Important props, sound design, camera movements
- Don't overuse - avoid RANDOM CAPITALIZATION

### 3. Character Cues

Character names appear above their dialogue, centered.

**Format:**
```
                    CHARACTER NAME
                    Here's their dialogue line.
```

**Rules:**
- Always centered
- Match character name exactly throughout script
- Use (V.O.) for voice-over
- Use (O.S.) for off-screen

### 4. Dialogue

The actual spoken words by characters.

**Format:**
- Left margin: 3.7" from left edge
- Right margin: 2.7" from right edge
- Single-spaced
- No quotation marks needed

### 5. Extensions

Extensions appear next to character names to indicate how dialogue is delivered.

**Common Extensions:**
- `(V.O.)` - Voice Over
- `(O.S.)` - Off Screen
- `(CONT'D)` - Continued (when character speaks again after action)
- `(PRE-LAP)` - Dialogue starts before scene begins

### 6. Parentheticals

Instructions for how dialogue should be delivered.

**Format:**
```
                    CHARACTER NAME
                    (parenthetical)
                    Dialogue line here.
```

**Rules:**
- Use sparingly
- Only when necessary for clarity
- Place above dialogue line
- Keep brief and specific

### 7. Screenplay Transitions

Instructions for how scenes connect.

**Common Transitions:**
- `CUT TO:`
- `FADE IN:`
- `FADE OUT:`
- `DISSOLVE TO:`
- `SMASH CUT TO:`

**Format:**
- Right-aligned
- Always capitalized
- Use sparingly

### 8. Subheaders

Used for scenes within a larger location.

**Format:**
```
INT. MORT'S HOUSE - DAY #4#

                    KITCHEN
Mort chops vegetables with precision.

                    LIVING ROOM
His wife reads on the couch.
```

### 9. Shots

Specific camera directions (use sparingly).

**Common Shots:**
- `CLOSE ON`
- `WIDE SHOT`
- `POV`
- `ANGLE ON`

**Note:** Let the director direct - only include when absolutely necessary for story.

### 10. Montage

Sequence of related scenes showing passage of time.

**Format:**
```
                    BEGIN MONTAGE

INT. GYM - DAY #5#
Rocky trains on the heavy bag.

EXT. STREETS - DAWN #6#
Rocky jogs through Philadelphia.

EXT. MUSEUM STEPS - DAY #7#
Rocky runs up the famous steps.

                    END MONTAGE
```

### 11. Lyrics

For musical sequences.

**Two Options:**

**Option 1 - Space It Out:**
```
                    MUSICAL SEQUENCE

                    (SINGING)
                    "I'm walking on sunshine..."

                    WIDE SHOT
                    The entire cast dances in the street.

                    (SINGING)
                    "And don't it feel good!"
```

**Option 2 - Describe the Sequence:**
```
                    MUSICAL NUMBER
                    The cast breaks into an elaborate dance
                    sequence celebrating their victory.
```

### 12. Chyrons

Text that appears over the screen.

**Format:**
```
                    CHYRON: "Three months later..."
```

**Alternative:**
```
                    TITLE: "Three months later..."
```

### 13. End of Act (TV Only)

For network television scripts with commercial breaks.

**Format:**
```
                    End of Act One
                    
                    (skip page)
                    
                    Act Two
```

## Fountain Format Compatibility

This project uses Fountain format, which is a plain-text markup language for screenplays. Most of these formatting rules apply to Fountain as well:

- Use `INT.` and `EXT.` for scene headings
- Character names in ALL CAPS
- Use `*bold*` for emphasis
- Use `#` for scene headings
- Use `> ` for centered text (character names, transitions)

## Best Practices

1. **Clarity is King** - Write for production, not just reading
2. **Be Precise** - Department heads will take descriptions literally
3. **Show, Don't Tell** - Focus on visual storytelling
4. **Keep It Moving** - Avoid static scenes
5. **Professional Format** - Follow industry standards exactly
6. **Read Scripts** - Study professional examples for reference

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Random capitalization
- Overuse of camera directions
- Too many parentheticals
- Improper slugline format
- Inconsistent character names
- Missing scene transitions
- Overly long action blocks
