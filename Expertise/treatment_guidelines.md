# Feature Film Treatment Guidelines

## Structure Overview

Create a 5-page feature film treatment following this exact structure and proportional allocation:

### PAGE 1 - ACT 1 SETUP (25% of story, 50% of page allocation)
- Open with a compelling visual that captures tone/theme
- Introduce protagonist in ordinary world showing character flaws/wants vs needs
- Establish 2-3 key supporting characters and primary relationships
- Weave theme through early dialogue or situation (page 5 equivalent)
- Build to catalyst/inciting incident that disrupts status quo (page 12 equivalent)
- End with protagonist's debate/resistance to change (pages 12-25 equivalent)

### PAGE 1-2 TRANSITION - BREAK INTO ACT 2 (2-3 paragraphs maximum)
- Protagonist commits to journey, crosses threshold into new world
- Introduce B-story relationship that will carry thematic weight
- Establish new rules/stakes of story world

### PAGES 2-3 - ACT 2A: FUN AND GAMES (30% of story)
- Deliver premise promise - show what audience came to see
- Protagonist explores new world, initial victories and setbacks
- Develop B-story relationship and supporting character dynamics
- Build complications toward midpoint with escalating stakes

### PAGE 3 - MIDPOINT CRISIS (1-2 paragraphs only)
- Major reversal: false victory becomes defeat OR apparent defeat reveals hidden strength
- Stakes double, protagonist's current approach proven insufficient
- Clear pivot point that changes story direction

### PAGES 3-4 - ACT 2B: COMPLICATIONS (25% of story)
- External forces and internal doubts intensify pressure
- Supporting characters choose sides or complicate matters
- Build to "All is Lost" moment where hope seems gone
- Dark night of soul: protagonist processes failure, finds key insight

### PAGES 4-5 - ACT 3: RESOLUTION (20% of story)
- Armed with new understanding, protagonist breaks into finale
- Climactic confrontation using lesson learned from theme
- Resolve both A-story plot and B-story relationship
- End with final image opposite of opening, showing transformation
