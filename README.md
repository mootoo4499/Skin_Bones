# Skin & Bones

A comprehensive screenplay adaptation project based on the novel "Skin & Bones: A Novel" by Renee Watson, featuring a multi-database knowledge graph system for story development and analysis.

## Project Overview

This project transforms the novel into a screenplay through systematic analysis and adaptation, utilizing Neo4j knowledge graphs to manage complex story relationships, character development, and narrative structure.

### Story Analysis
The novel centers on **Lena**, a Black museum director navigating body image, family relationships, and professional challenges in Portland. Key themes include:
- **Identity & Body Image**: Lena's struggle with weight and self-acceptance
- **Generational Relationships**: Complex mother-daughter dynamics with Honey
- **Forgiveness & Betrayal**: Romantic and friendship conflicts requiring reconciliation
- **Cultural Heritage**: The "Reclaiming Vanport" museum exhibit as metaphor for personal reclamation

### Character Network
- **Lena** (Protagonist): Museum director, mother, fiancée
- **Honey** (Mother): Complex relationship around food, control, and care
- **Aaliyah** (8-year-old daughter): Central to maternal crisis arc
- **Malcolm** (Fiancé): Betrayal and reconciliation storyline
- **Bryan** (Ex): Return during crisis, alternative romantic path
- **Kendra** (Best friend): Professional betrayal and friendship repair

## Project Structure

### Core Files
- `Beat_sheet_Outline.md` - Complete story structure breakdown
- `SkinBones.fountain` - Screenplay in Fountain format
- `treatment_guidelines.md` - Adaptation methodology
- `format_guidelines.md` - Screenplay formatting standards

### Knowledge Graph System
Multi-database Neo4j architecture for comprehensive story management:

#### Database Design
1. **`skinbones_book`** - Source material analysis
2. **`skinbones_screenplay`** - Live adaptation work
3. **`screenplay_expertise`** - Industry knowledge base
4. **`screenplay_examples`** - Reference library from Scripts_Corpus

### Scripts_Corpus
Extensive collection of screenplay character data for reference and analysis:
- Character dialogue patterns from major films
- Genre-specific writing techniques
- Successful adaptation examples

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Setup
- Multi-database schema design
- Source material digitization and relationship mapping
- Expert knowledge integration

### Phase 2: Adaptive Analysis
- Character arc tracking across book-to-screen translation
- Theme preservation and visual adaptation
- Dialogue optimization for screen format

### Phase 3: Iterative Development
- Version-controlled screenplay drafts
- Feedback integration and revision tracking
- Cross-reference with successful adaptation patterns

## Technical Stack
- **Neo4j**: Multi-database knowledge graphs
- **Fountain**: Screenplay markup format
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Database connectivity
- **Scripts_Corpus**: Reference character dialogue database

## Getting Started

This project requires Neo4j credentials for full functionality. The knowledge graph system enables sophisticated story analysis, character relationship tracking, and adaptation decision documentation.
