### ACT I - OPENING IMAGE & SETUP

A sterile doctor's office becomes a battlefield of dignity. LENA, a Black woman whose quiet strength radiates despite her vulnerability, sits squeezed into a too-small gown, the fabric straining against her body like her spirit strains against the world's expectations. A blood pressure cuff bites into her arm as a nurse types the cruel assessment into her chart: "morbidly obese but seems happy." The irony cuts deep—Lena's happiness is a performance, a shield against a society that reduces her to numbers and assumptions. She twists her sparkling engagement ring, her mind drifting not to her upcoming wedding but to her deepest fear: dying fat. Everything about her is big and Black, big and majestic like the ocean, every bit of her hard to contain. Her belly spills over, and so do her tears, her joy, every family recipe, every heartache, every weekend spent at Seaside Beach. It's all here with her, heavy, holding all this Blackness, holding all this bigness.

In her vibrant Portland home, Lena's world appears perfectly orchestrated. As a museum director, she commands respect and admiration, her passion project—the "Reclaiming Vanport" exhibit—representing not just her professional achievement but her family's legacy. Her relationship with her eight-year-old daughter AALIYAH reveals both fierce protectiveness and inherited anxiety. Aaliyah innocently calls her vitamins "strong pills" and Lena's appetite suppressants "beauty pills," unaware of the complex relationship her mother has with both nourishment and self-destruction. When HONEY, Lena's formidable mother, visits, the kitchen becomes a stage for their ongoing battle—Honey pushing food as love while Lena enforces restrictions that mirror her own internal warfare.

The foundation of Lena's carefully constructed life appears solid. Her fiancé MALCOLM demonstrates genuine love and consideration, choosing restaurants with chairs that accommodate her, showing the thoughtful attention that initially drew her to him. During wine nights with her best friend KENDRA, also plus-sized and navigating the brutal landscape of dating apps, Lena seems confident about her choices. Professional success flows as she secures major funding for the Vanport exhibit, work that connects her to her grandfather's church and the sacred pews that anchor Portland's Black history. The specter of BRYAN, Aaliyah's father and Lena's ex, lingers in conversations but feels like ancient history.

But beneath this polished surface, Lena carries decades of beauty standards and insecurities, always wondering why and how. If she figures out why Malcolm chose her, maybe she can fix anything that threatens their bond. She knows—intellectually—that her worth isn't tied to her body, but what she needs to work on is getting her emotions and mind to align.

The wedding day arrives in a burst of celebration and expectation. Lena stands radiant in her bridal gown, surrounded by family and friends whose joy fills every corner of the venue. Then Malcolm arrives, insisting he must speak with her immediately. Through a crack in the bedroom door, just moments before she would walk down the aisle, he delivers a devastating confession: during a past breakup, he slept with another woman. The revelation shatters not just the wedding but Lena's faith in love itself. The celebration stops, the guests disperse, and Lena confronts the ruins of her carefully planned future.

In the aftermath, Lena faces a chorus of conflicting advice that leaves her feeling more isolated than supported. Honey pushes for forgiveness, arguing that Lena's rigidity will cost her true love and that grace is the cornerstone of any lasting relationship. Friends divide into camps—some supporting Malcolm's honesty, others condemning his timing. The return of Bryan, arriving in Portland following his mother's death, offers the intoxicating comfort of familiar arms and shared history. He makes his intentions clear: he came back for her and Aaliyah, and he's here to stay. Rather than choose between forgiveness and resentment, between Malcolm and Bryan, Lena retreats into the one area where she feels control—her work, burying herself in the history of Black Portland for her museum exhibit.

### BREAK INTO ACT II

Unable to maintain her independence, Lena and Aaliyah move in with Honey, transforming what should have been her sanctuary into a complex battleground of love and control. Every meal becomes a negotiation between Lena's health-conscious restrictions for Aaliyah and Honey's belief that food equals comfort and care. The generational patterns that Lena hoped to break reassert themselves with new intensity. Her professional refuge crumbles when the museum board formalizes the cancellation of "Reclaiming Vanport," beginning the process to deaccession the sacred pews and effectively erasing the work that defined her identity. Malcolm relentlessly pursues reconciliation while Bryan makes romantic overtures, leaving Lena trapped between past and future, between safety and risk.

### ACT II - FUN AND GAMES

Lena attempts to navigate her new reality through a series of increasingly complicated relationships. Bryan takes her on dates that feel like time travel, rekindling old chemistry while Honey watches from the sidelines with maternal disapproval, treating Bryan like the high school boyfriend she never trusted. Meanwhile, the museum forces Lena to work alongside Malcolm on salvaging pieces of the Vanport exhibit, creating forced proximity that oscillates between professional efficiency and personal tension. They navigate Portland's cultural bureaucracy together, their shared passion for the project rekindling emotional intimacy even as trust remains fractured.

The wine nights with Kendra become more frequent and necessary as Lena processes her romantic confusion and professional disappointment. Living with Honey returns Lena to childhood dynamics, but now with Aaliyah as witness and participant, creating three-generational tension around food, independence, and love. Honey's well-meaning interference clashes with Lena's determination to parent differently, while Aaliyah absorbs lessons about self-worth, beauty, and the complex relationship between love and control.

Bryan's presence grows more significant as he integrates himself into their daily routine, helping with Aaliyah and offering the stability that Malcolm's betrayal destroyed. But his return also forces Lena to confront why their relationship ended originally and whether desperation makes for good decision-making. The professional collaboration with Malcolm reveals their continued intellectual and emotional compatibility, even as personal trust remains elusive.

### MIDPOINT CRISIS

The careful balance Lena has maintained explodes when Malcolm reveals the identity of the woman he slept with during their breakup—and worse, that Kendra has known all along. The revelation arrives in an "unsent letter" conversation where Malcolm, desperate to rebuild trust, inadvertently exposes Kendra's betrayal. Lena discovers that her best friend, hired as a stylist by the other woman, chose financial security over friendship loyalty. When confronted, Kendra's justification cuts deep: the affair happened during Malcolm and Lena's breakup, so revealing it wasn't her place, and besides, her business relationship with the woman pays her bills. The double betrayal—romantic and platonic—leaves Lena questioning every relationship in her life.

### ACT II - BAD GUYS CLOSE IN

Lena's support system systematically crumbles as she becomes increasingly isolated and controlling. Her strictness with Aaliyah around food and health becomes obsessive, reflecting her desperate attempt to protect her daughter from the pain she experienced. This creates escalating conflict with Honey, who sees Lena's rigid rules as harmful and herself steps in with lenient alternatives. The tension at home mirrors the professional stress as Lena watches her life's work literally packed up and removed from the museum, with Malcolm present as both helper and reminder of personal failure.

School bullying compounds Aaliyah's stress at home, creating a perfect storm of pressure around food, self-image, and family instability. Lena's "beauty pills" become a dangerous temptation for a child trying to understand why the adults in her life seem so unhappy with their bodies. The situation escalates when Aaliyah, overwhelmed by school bullying and family tension, accidentally overdoses on Lena's appetite suppressants.

### ALL IS LOST

The call comes while Lena works with Malcolm at the museum—Honey's panicked voice announcing that Aaliyah has been rushed to the hospital. Malcolm immediately shifts into protective father mode, driving Lena to the hospital despite their complicated relationship. At the emergency room, Lena dismisses Malcolm, promising updates while asking him to handle the museum crisis. She finds Honey in the surgical waiting area, both women confronting their worst fears about their parenting choices.

When the doctor emerges with cautiously optimistic news—Aaliyah will survive, though risks remain—the relief comes tangled with guilt and recrimination. Social services arrives, adding bureaucratic scrutiny to personal anguish. The hospital becomes a pressure cooker where three generations of women must confront the cycles of protection and control that have shaped their family for decades.

### DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

Through the long hospital night, Lena and Honey finally have their reckoning. Exhausted and raw, Lena confesses her deepest fear: that the worst parts of herself are all she's given Aaliyah. Honey, watching her daughter's anguish, faces her own role in perpetuating harmful patterns around food and self-worth. In this moment of mutual vulnerability, Honey offers the accountability Lena has needed: her protection came from fear, and she's sorry for not knowing how to want better for her daughter. She acknowledges that despite any mistakes, Lena has become a good mother.

Kendra's unexpected arrival with a care package—cutting short a work trip to be present for her friend—begins the process of relationship repair. The gesture demonstrates that love sometimes transcends business decisions and that forgiveness might be possible even after betrayal.

### ACT III - BREAK INTO THREE

Honey's words become the catalyst for Lena's transformation: "No one is ever doing it right. Whatever we face, the best any of us can ever do is face it together." This maternal blessing gives Lena permission to stop pursuing perfection and start embracing authenticity. The reconciliation with Honey provides the emotional foundation Lena needs to rebuild other relationships and reclaim her professional passion.

### FINALE

Armed with new understanding about love, forgiveness, and self-worth, Lena refuses to let her exhibit disappear quietly. She organizes an alternative showcase that celebrates Black Portland history on her own terms—a literal and metaphorical reclaiming of space. The event becomes both professional triumph and personal declaration, proving that being erased requires compliance.

At the exhibit, Lena delivers a powerful speech that synthesizes her journey: she asks the audience to take a good look at her, to see all of her, because "Reclaiming Vanport" is about reclaiming their stories, centering their experiences, and taking up space. She speaks her truth aloud so that her humanity is centered more than her accomplishments, declaring that she deserves a comfortable seat, deserves to be heard when she speaks up for what she needs.

The reconciliation with Kendra happens quietly on her porch, with wine and simple honesty: Kendra's apology, stripped of justifications, opens the door to renewed friendship. Malcolm approaches during the exhibit celebration with his own evolved understanding of love and accountability. His proposal acknowledges their imperfect history while embracing the possibility of growth: "Ours is a love story still being written. A tattered love knitted together by grace. Will you keep writing our story? Will you marry me?"

Lena's acceptance—"Yes, Malcolm. I will marry you. Yes, yes!"—represents not surrender but empowerment, choosing love while maintaining her hard-won self-knowledge.

### FINAL IMAGE

The film closes with Lena dancing at the makeshift exhibit, surrounded by her community and flanked by Honey and Aaliyah. She asks her daughter the question that completes her arc: "Aaliyah, do you know how powerful we are, how powerful you are?" The three generations stand together, having broken the cycle of shame and control, replacing it with celebration and strength. Where the opening image showed Lena contained and diminished by medical machinery, the final image shows her expansive and free, taking up space not in apology but in triumph. Her body, her Blackness, her bigness are no longer burdens to be managed but gifts to be celebrated, and she passes this knowledge to her daughter like a sacred inheritance.
