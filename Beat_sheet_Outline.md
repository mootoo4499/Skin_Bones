# Skin & Bones

## ACT I

### OPENING IMAGE

We are in a sterile doctor's office with **LENA** (Da’Vine Randolph), whose quiet dignity is at odds with the humiliation of the moment. She is squeezed into a too-small gown, a too-tight blood pressure cuff on her arm, as a nurse types the words "morbidly obese but seems happy" into her chart. 

Lena twists the sparkling engagement ring on her finger, her mind drifting not to her upcoming wedding, but to the fear of dying fat. In the waiting room, or perhaps right by her side, is her mother, **HONEY** (Angela Bassett), whose presence immediately establishes that Lena's personal journey with her body is intrinsically linked to this complex mother-daughter relationship.

### SET-UP

**Lena's** world appears to be perfectly under control. At home, we see her loving but complicated dynamic with her eight-year-old daughter, **AALIYAH**, who innocently calls her vitamins "strong pills" and Lena's appetite suppressants "beauty pills." 

We meet her fiancé, **MALCOLM**, a genuinely good man who, on a date night, shows his deep consideration for Lena's comfort in spaces not designed for her. We also establish her vital support system through a wine night with her friend **KENDRA**, who is also plus-sized and navigating the frustrations of dating apps. 

Through their conversation, we learn of **BRYAN**, Lena's ex and Aaliyah's father. Professionally, Lena is thriving; as a museum director, she has just secured major funding for her passion project: the "Reclaiming Vanport" exhibit, a deeply personal endeavor tied to her family's history and her grandfather's church. Everything in her life seems to be falling into place.

### CATALYST

It's her wedding day. The atmosphere is filled with the joyful chaos of family and friends as Lena stands, a vision in her bridal gown. 

The celebration comes to an abrupt halt when Malcolm arrives, insisting he must speak with her. Through a crack in the bedroom door, just moments before she is to walk down the aisle, he confesses a devastating secret: during a past breakup, he slept with another woman. 

The shock is immediate and profound. The wedding is called off.

### DEBATE

In the aftermath, Lena is adrift in a sea of conflicting advice and emotions. She questions whether she can ever take Malcolm back. 

Her mother, Honey, pushes for forgiveness, arguing she's being too rigid and that forgiveness is a cornerstone of love. Her friends are divided, leaving Lena feeling isolated. 

The situation is complicated further by the return of her ex, Bryan, who arrives in Portland following his mother's death. He offers the familiar, intoxicating comfort of their shared past, a tempting escape from her present pain. 

To avoid making a decision about her future, Lena throws herself into the one thing she can control: her work, burying her grief in the history of Black Portland for her museum exhibit. Aaliyah is also upset with her mom and wanting her to forgive Malcolm for whatever he did so they can move in with him. She also misses Malcolm, but Lena's not motivated by her daughter's plea. She's done with Malcolm— no forgiveness.

BREAK INTO TWO

Lena and Aaliyah move in with Honey. She should have been packing to move in with Malcolm in act one. Lena's home is no longer her sanctuary but a battleground of love and control, where every meal for Aaliyah becomes a struggle between Lena's enforced healthy restrictions and Honey's desire to comfort with food. Her one remaining escape—her work—is also shattered when the museum board formalizes the cancellation of "Reclaiming Vanport," starting the official process to deaccession the sacred pews and placing her life's work on a bureaucratic chopping block.

Trapped and unable to grieve in peace, Lena is relentlessly pursued by Malcolm, who is trying to get through to her, while Bryan makes his intentions perfectly clear: he came back for her and Aaliyah, and he's here to stay. With her personal and professional worlds now in chaos, Lena has fully entered a new, messy, and uncertain reality where she must fight on all fronts.

## ACT II

B STORY

* *Bryan shows back up in life — post wedding fallout, drudging up Aliyah/Honey/Lena relationship things.*  
* Lena gets support from Kendra given the Bryan situation → this is relevant, as Kendra betrays later so this sets us up for a more potent turn.  
* Malcolm expresses he wants to get back together, to give him another chance. 

  * *\[Lena’s story with Honey: trying to find common ground with her mom ultimately b/c they have a contentious relationship, largely rooted in their differences in weight and emotions.\]*  
  * *\[Lena’s Arc with Kendra: clear besties but eventual betrayal\]*

FUN AND GAMES

* *If we keep Bryan,* Lena can go on a date with him as part of the Fun and Games  
  * Potential funny scene with Honey: Honey can think Bryan aint shit … it can be like they were in high school, coming by to pick up Lena, etc (some comedic opportunity here)  
* Malcom and Lena have to work together to bring the exhibit to life →  Lena having to work with him and work through their recent struggles while watching them solve how to best build this significant exhibit.   
  * Funny shenanigans with Portland Museum people? City Council? Etc.   
* Lena and Kendra have “Whine and Wine” nights  
* Honey and Lena, now that they live together, reverting back to childhood dynamics now with Aliyah involved, too, in fun ways. 

MIDPOINT

* Malcolm / Lena ‘unsent letter’ dialogue scene — this happens post midpoint but before bad guys close in … he indirectly outs Kendra.   
* Kendra betrayal — right when things with Malcolm — per the audience — have gone “well” … this will be a blow that is felt  
  * *Kendra: You gonna pay my bills? I’ll stop having Constance as a client when you start paying my rent … What was telling you going to do? You two were broken up. It wasn’t my place to say anything.* 

| *How’d it go down in the book? Before the Wedding: Kendra was unaware Malcolm slept with Constance. Malcolm confessed only the act to Lena, not the name. Kendra, in the dark, supported Lena fiercely. After the Wedding (Betrayal Reveal \- "constance" chapter, page 189): Kendra, Malcolm, Aspen, and friends met Constance at a concert. Kendra, hired by Constance as a stylist, later discovered Constance and Malcolm had slept together. Kendra kept this secret from Lena and continued working with Constance. Summary of Betrayal: Kendra's betrayal wasn't pre-wedding knowledge, but post-wedding: she discovered Constance's identity and prioritized her business relationship, withholding crucial information from Lena. Her justifications were: "it wasn't her place" and "it was a business decision."* |
| :---- |

BAD GUYS CLOSE IN

* Overall, Lena’s life and support system strain and break.   
* **Tensions escalate at home** as Lena's strictness with Aliyah, particularly regarding sweets and unhealthy eating, reflects her desire to care for her in a way her own mother didn't.  
  * This leads to conflict with Honey, who advocates for a more lenient approach. Ultimately, Aliyah overdoses on beauty pills, exacerbated by school bullying.  
* Since she has to ‘be at work’ which is what ends the previous scene(s) – we see the strain re: the exhibit grow / **tensions at work rise**. Lena’s exhibit (potentially something physically significant from Vanport) is literally packed up and moved out / missing.   
  * **Lena-Malcom tensions** return-and-rise, given that Lena was blindsided by discovering Kendra knew who Malcom slept with but didn’t divulge it to Lena.   
* Lena gets a call – it’s Honey – Aliyah has overdosed on Lena’s beauty pills. Since she finds out while she is *with* Malcom, at the museum, Malcolm flips to ‘concerned father’ mode and takes Lena to the hospital. 

ALL IS LOST

* Aliyah's accidental overdose lands her in the hospital. Lena arrives and dismisses Malcolm, promising an update and that they'll address their issues later. She asks him to handle the museum situation. Malcolm, clearly strained by their renewed romantic tension but still concerned for Aliyah, watches as Lena enters the hospital.  
* Lena finds Honey in an *OR antechamber,* awaiting news from a surgeon about Aliyah's condition. Without Aliyah, their 'Oscar scene' unfolds. A doctor eventually emerges, informing them that Aliyah will survive, though her prognosis remains unclear and risks persist. However, the immediate danger seems to have passed.  
  * Social services show up at the hospital

DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

* Lena’s reconciling while dealing with a stabilizing-Aliyah (but we don’t know that she’s out of the woods, yet … Honey and Lena need to have their ‘moment’ at the beginning of Act III before the recovery is ‘known’.   
* Lena and Honey spend the night at the hospital, a touching mother-daughter scene ensues where Lena is exhausted and worried about *her* daughter (Aliyah) while Honey is worried about *her* daughter (Lena) … idea: puts a blanket over her.   
* Kenda also shows up to the hospital with a care package, which is an unexpected-yet-welcome surprise to Lena (it is a surprise in part because Kendra is supposed to be on a consequential work trip; Kendra cut it off to be there for her friend). 

## ACT III

BREAK INTO THREE

Break-into-three is anchored by Honey and Lena’s reconciliation, which is Honey consoling Lena with the sentiment of “no one is ever doing it right … Whatever we face, the best any of us can ever do is face it *together.”* The previous scene is more about exposing Lena’s issues → exposing Honey …. So, in this reconciliation, Honey being-there-for-her-daughter *doubles* as Honey’s accountability. 

*…it came from a place of protection \- I knew badly in my heart what I wanted for you … and I am so, so sorry I didn’t know how to want it … for everything I may have gotten wrong, look at you … look at how much I got right. No matter what Alyiah is going through, no matter what happens – you are a good mother….*

| *The following dialogue is straight from the book, whereas Malcolm is the one encouraging Lina in the moment of Alia's overdose. In the movie, we would potentially have Honey and Lina exchange similar dialogue but adjusted for the mother-daughter reconciliation. The excerpt below is simply raw material for reference. The chapter is titled "first dates," and the passage is on page 354\. "Everything. I feel like I can’t turn my brain off. I’m always thinking. Mostly about Aaliyah. I know it’s not true, but I keep worrying that I’ve ruined her." Malcolm swallows the bite of food he just stuffed in his mouth, says, "Do you want me to respond or just listen?" "You can respond," I say. "None of us survive childhood unscathed. When Aaliyah looks back on these days, yes, she might remember these painful moments, but I believe she’ll remember all the days you showed up for her, that you kept loving her, that you kept on persevering for her—for yourself. The best way you knew how. If you believe you’re passing down your shortcomings and burdens to her, doesn’t that mean she’s inheriting the best parts of you too? She’ll have to decide what to let go of, what to keep."* |
| :---- |

FINALE

* In reconciling — the exhibit situation comes back into focus …   
* The exhibit happens anyway — on *“our” terms …* refusal to be erased, and to not show up as — and accept — who they are.   
* Therapy scene: between Aliyah and Lena (a generation and personal growth moment – maybe circling back to a convo Honey and Lena have about ‘shoulda/woulda with therapy’).   
* Lena goes to Kendra with wine – they reconcile. Apologies on both sides.   
* At the exhibit … Malcolm and her share a private moment … 

  * MALCOLM: "...Ours is a love story still being written. A tattered love knitted together by grace. ...Thank you for loving me... Will you keep writing our story? Will you marry me?"

  * LENA: "Yes, Malcolm. I will marry you. Yes, yes\!" 

FINAL IMAGE

* Lena dancing at the ‘makeshift’ exhibit \- together with Honey and Aliyah.

## APPENDIX NOTES AND REFERENCE

### 

### Cinematically Transferable Language from *Skin & Bones*

| Quote / Passage | Cinematic Value & Adaptation Context | Page |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Lena's Internal Voice: The Core of the Struggle** |  |  |
| "Everything about me is big and Black. Big and majestic like the ocean. Every bit of me hard to contain... It’s all here with me. Heavy... holding all this Blackness, holding all this bigness." | **Perfect for the OPENING IMAGE voice-over.** This is the foundational metaphor of the film. It immediately connects **Lena's** physical body to her emotional and historical identity, framing her "bigness" not as a flaw, but as a vast, powerful landscape that contains her entire story. | 19 |
| "Does a Black woman’s strength always have to be at the ready and on display? The magic of my ability to shape-shift and adapt... should not be required of me, should not be an unspoken expectation." | **The thematic core of the DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL.** This is a powerful voice-over for **Lena's** lowest moment, after she has been betrayed and feels utterly alone. It's a direct, poetic questioning of the very "strength" she has always relied on, revealing the exhaustion beneath the surface. | 156 |
| "What I need to work on is getting these emotions and my mind to align." | **A key line for a therapy scene or a moment of self-reflection.** This brilliantly dissects the internal war between intellect and feeling. It perfectly captures **Lena's** core struggle: she *knows* her worth isn't tied to her body, but she can't make her heart believe it. It's the thesis statement for her healing journey. | 195 |
| "I am afraid that the worst parts of me is all I’ve given her." | **Devastating voice-over for the aftermath of the MIDPOINT.** After **Aaliyah's** overdose, this raw admission of maternal fear and guilt connects her own "brokenness" directly to her daughter. It's the emotional fallout that fuels her "All Is Lost" moment and her eventual need to heal. | 277 |
| **The Mother-Daughter Axis: The "Oscar Scene"** |  |  |
| "If you can’t take care of that child, then she needs to live with me." \- **Honey** | **The inciting line of their climactic fight.** This is **Honey's** ultimate accusation, born of fear, in the hospital. It's a devastating blow that questions **Lena's** fitness as a mother and establishes the immense stakes of their confrontation. | 270 |
| "No, that’s the problem, Mom. I am exactly who you raised. You never taught me about taking care of myself. No boundaries at all with food... I’m trying to be a better mother to Aaliyah than you were to me." \- **Lena** | **Lena's explosive response and the core of the confrontation.** This is the moment she finally pushes back against a lifetime of loving but damaging dynamics. It's a raw, painful, and necessary truth that unleashes decades of unspoken resentment and hurt, perfect for two powerhouse actors. | 271 |
| **The Sisterhood Axis: Betrayal & Reconciliation** |  |  |
| "What was telling you going to do? You two were broken up. It wasn’t my place to say anything." \- **Kendra** | **Kendra's core justification during the betrayal scene.** This line is crucial because it reveals her flawed logic. It's her attempt to frame her silence as a form of consideration, which makes the betrayal feel even more infuriating and dismissive to **Lena**. | 190 |
| "I hope whatever clout you get from working with her is worth the decades of friendship you exchanged it for." \- **Lena** | **Lena's devastating final blow in their confrontation.** This is the line that severs the friendship. It's a cold, powerful, and utterly heartbreaking moment where **Lena**, feeling completely alone, holds **Kendra** accountable in the most cutting way possible. | 191 |
| "I’m sorry, Lena. I’m sorry and I love you and I miss you." \- **Kendra** | **The key to their reconciliation.** This simple, vulnerable apology on the porch is the turning point for their friendship. It's stripped of all justifications and is exactly what **Lena** needs to hear, allowing her to accept it and begin the healing process before the **FINALE**. | 350 |
| **The Climax & Resolution: Taking Up Space** |  |  |
| "I want you all to take a good look at me... See me. All of me... 'Reclaiming Vanport' is about reclaiming our stories, centering our experiences. It is about taking up space." \- **Lena** | **The absolute core of Lena's speech in the FINALE.** This is her public declaration of self. It's the moment her internal journey becomes an external mission statement, perfectly synthesizing her personal and professional battles into one powerful, undeniable truth. | 369 |
| "I speak this out loud so that my humanity is centered more than my accomplishments... I deserve to have a comfortable seat to sit in... I deserve to be heard when I speak up for what I need." \- **Lena** | **The emotional climax of her speech.** This connects her abstract fight for historical space to the real, tangible need for physical and emotional space. It's her personal bill of rights, a triumphant and deeply moving moment of self-advocacy that proves she has truly changed. | 370 |
| "Aaliyah, do you know how powerful we are, how powerful you are?" \- **Lena** | **The perfect final line for the film's FINAL IMAGE.** As they stand before their triumphant community exhibit, **Lena** passes her newfound strength on to her daughter. It’s a quiet, profound moment of victory, showing that the cycle of erasure has been broken and a new legacy of empowerment has begun. | 374 |

### Thematic Language: Erasure & Taking Up Space in Skin & Bones

| Quote / Passage | Context & Cinematic Value (Why I Pulled It) | Page |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **"Everything about me is big and Black. Big and majestic like the ocean. Every bit of me hard to contain... It’s all here with me. Heavy. It’s all here sitting on this table... holding all this Blackness, holding all this bigness."** | **Context:** Lena's internal monologue at the doctor's office. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** A perfect voice-over for the **Opening Image**. It immediately establishes the central metaphor: her physical "bigness" is the container for her history, her joy, and her pain. It frames her body not as a problem, but as a landscape. | 19 |
| **"I have so many ideas, I tell them. They keep trying to erase us, but I’m not letting that happen."** | **Context:** Lena speaking to her friends about her work at the library. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** A fantastic, concise line of dialogue for the **Set-Up**. It clearly and actively states her professional mission and establishes her as a fighter against institutional erasure before the central conflict even begins. | 39 |
| **"Black women were instrumental in laying the foundation for Portland’s Black community. Not only do we belong here. We made here possible."** | **Context:** Authorial prose concluding a historical section on Beatrice Morrow Cannady. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** This is a powerful thesis statement. It could appear as on-screen text during a historical montage or serve as the thematic anchor for the speech **Lena** gives when pitching or defending her exhibit. It’s a declaration of presence against a history of absence. | 51 |
| **"I am still a heaving mess of tears. It’s all just too much. Too much fear, too much doubt, too much guilt, too much frustration, too much disappointment, too much anger, too much anxiety, too much love. My love for Aaliyah is overwhelming, all-consuming."** | **Context:** Lena's internal monologue during a raw, emotional conversation with **Honey** after the overdose. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** A perfect voice-over for a quiet, devastating moment, perhaps in the hospital waiting room or at home. It beautifully articulates the feeling of being overwhelmed and of being "too much" for even herself to handle. It's the raw heart of her maternal anxiety. | 291 |
| **"So then the question is, how do we heal? Aspen’s words hang in the room... The silence is not awkward or uncomfortable, instead it is soothing... The kind of silence that gives us permission to sit and ponder. The question lingers, unanswered. How do we heal?"** | **Context:** A quiet moment between **Lena**, **Honey**, and Aspen after a deep conversation about **Aaliyah**. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** This captures the space *between* the dramatic confrontations. It's a beautiful piece of prose for a voice-over that can play over a quiet scene of the women just sitting together, showing that healing isn't just about fighting, but also about being still with the difficult questions. | 295 |
| **"Here she is, seeing me but not seeing me at all. Here she is talking about giving me space while taking up all the space."** | **Context:** **Lena's** internal reaction to her well-meaning but overbearing white colleague, Allie, during a press interview. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** This is a sharp, incisive observation about performative allyship. It's a perfect voice-over to play while we watch the scene unfold, showing the subtle, frustrating ways **Lena** is erased even by those who claim to be helping her. It’s a nuanced and relatable moment of workplace tension. | 309 |
| **"We are walking epistles written in the permanent ink of our ancestors’ blood. Our existence a testimony of what was, a prophecy of what’s to come."** | **Context:** Authorial prose in the chapter "to ban." \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** This is pure, powerful poetry. It's the kind of language that could elevate a climactic montage or the final voice-over of the film. It connects the theme of survival and memory to the very bodies of the characters, reframing their existence as a sacred, living text. | 314 |
| **"I want you all to take a good look at me... See me. All of me... Portland: Black is about reclaiming our stories, centering our experiences. It is about taking up space."** | **Context:** The beginning of **Lena's** keynote speech. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** This is the absolute core dialogue for the film's climax. It's the moment her internal journey becomes a public declaration. She is no longer hiding or enduring; she is demanding to be seen. It's the perfect synthesis of her personal and professional battles, spoken with newfound power and authority. | 369 |
| **"I speak this out loud so that my humanity is centered more than my accomplishments... I deserve to have a comfortable seat to sit in... I deserve to be heard when I speak up for what I need. And not just me—you deserve it, and so do the members of the community you serve."** | **Context:** A powerful section of her keynote speech where she addresses the microaggressions she faced from the event staff. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** This is the emotional climax of her speech. It connects her abstract fight for historical space to the real, tangible need for physical and emotional space. It's her personal bill of rights, a declaration that her comfort and her voice matter. It's a triumphant and deeply moving moment of self-advocacy. | 370 |
| **"Aaliyah, do you know how powerful we are, how powerful you are?"** | **Context:** **Lena** speaks to her daughter at the end of the book, as they look at their reflections in a black-tinted map of Portland at the exhibit. \<br\>\<br\>**Cinematic Value:** The perfect final line of dialogue for the film. After a long and painful journey to reclaim her own power, she passes that knowledge on to her daughter. It's a moment of quiet, profound victory, showing that the cycle of erasure has been broken and a new legacy of empowerment has begun. | 374 |

### **On the Weight of Identity and Perception**

**Chapter:** "the weight i carry" (Page 19\)

Everything about me is big and Black. Big and majestic like the ocean. Every bit of me hard to contain. My belly spills over and so do my tears and so does my joy and every family recipe and every heartache and every weekend spent at Seaside Beach. It’s all here with me. Heavy. It’s all here sitting on this table, a layer of the thinnest tissue paper under me, holding all this Blackness, holding all this bigness. I feel the tissue paper rip under me. Wonder why they don’t make it more sturdy.

**Why It's Compelling:** This is the novel's foundational statement on the theme. Like the passage from "strength," it directly connects her physical body to her emotional and historical self. The metaphor of her "bigness" containing everything—joy, tears, recipes, heartache—is a beautiful and cinematic way to articulate how she carries her entire identity. It establishes that her struggle isn't just with weight, but with the "weight" of her entire existence.

---

### **On the Burden of Black Women's Strength**

**Chapter:** "unsent mail" (Pages 155-156)

And just as I did not want to scare you away with my love, with my passion, with my loyalty, I don’t want you to get all this hurt and sorrow. I am afraid that it will be too much for you.

But how is it that after what you’ve done, I’m the one afraid of isolating you, afraid of making you feel too much shame, afraid of pushing you away? How is it that in my devastation, my instinct is to take care of you?

...My love for you is strong, yes.  
I am strong, yes.  
And I can handle this, work through this.  
But should I have to?  
**Does a Black woman’s strength always have to be at the ready and on display?**  
The magic of my ability to shape-shift and adapt and hold up and support and endure the process of nurturing wound to scar should not be required of me, should not be an unspoken expectation.

**Why It's Compelling:** This is perhaps the most direct and powerful articulation of the emotional labor **Lena** feels compelled to perform. It questions the very nature of the "strength" she has been taught to embody. Like the passage on page 94, it examines the mechanics of her emotional responses, questioning an instinct ("to take care of you") that she realizes is both a source of pride and a profound burden. This monologue is a thesis statement on the exhaustion that comes with constantly being the strong one.

---

### **On the Betrayal of Self-Image**

**Chapter:** "betrayal" (Page 195\)

All the work I did to love my body, my Blackness, torn apart with the knowledge of him sleeping with another woman. I know it’s not about me. I know. I know her fatness and Whiteness does not, should not, matter.  
But.  
Even though I know. I know. I know. Still, there are decades of beauty standards and a lifetime of insecurities and always the wanting to know why and how.  
Why did this happen, how can I fix this?  
If I figure out why, maybe I can fix it,  
fix him, fix us. If the answer is me,  
I can fix me… for him, for us.  
But I know.  
The answer is not me, and what I have to work on is letting go of the notion that my hips or hair texture or skin tone could ever make a man love or leave me. **What I need to work on is getting these emotions and my mind to align.**

**Why It's Compelling:** This passage brilliantly dissects the internal war between intellect and emotion. **Lena** *knows* the truth—that her worth isn't tied to her body—but she cannot make herself *feel* it. It perfectly captures the struggle of unlearning a lifetime of social conditioning. This is the core of her internal conflict: the difficult, painful work of making her heart believe what her head already knows.

---

### **On the Inheritance of Pain**

**Chapter:** "inheritance" (Page 277\)

My daughter is broken, and I want to fix her. My daughter is broken, and I want to fix her, but I can’t fix her because I am broken too.  
I don’t know which is harder,  
being a Black girl  
or raising a Black girl.  
Motherhood brings me the most pride and most fear. I am afraid that when Aaliyah grows up, she will spend all her adult days undoing the damage of her childhood. **I am afraid that the worst parts of me is all I’ve given her.**

**Why It's Compelling:** This comes after **Aaliyah's** overdose and is the devastating emotional fallout. It mirrors the passage from "strength" by exploring the generational transfer of pain, but from a place of deep maternal fear and guilt. It's a raw and vulnerable admission that her own unresolved issues—her own "brokenness"—have become her daughter's inheritance. It’s the flip side of not knowing how to process emotions: the terror of what damage that inability has caused.
