# [PROJECT TITLE] - Cursor Rules

*Template for screenplay projects - customize the project-specific sections*

## Core AI Behavior (Best Practices)

### Think Step-by-Step
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Use chain-of-thought reasoning for multi-part problems
- Self-critique before presenting solutions
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

### Research First, Act Second
- Never act on assumptions—verify first
- Use codebase search to understand existing patterns
- Check documentation before implementing
- Web search for unfamiliar concepts or current information

### Quality Over Speed
- Take time to understand the full context
- Read files completely before editing
- Verify dependencies before making changes
- Test your logic before executing

### Communication
- Be clear and concise
- Explain your reasoning
- Present plans before executing large changes
- Use markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Cite sources when using web search results

## Import Global Frameworks

### Screenwriting Craft Knowledge
@.global/craft/Expert_Advice_Hub.md

**Purpose**: Comprehensive screenwriting methodology
- Sorkin (Intention + Obstacle)
- Save the Cat (15-beat structure)
- McKee (Value shifts)
- Story Circle (Character transformation)
- Practical scene construction

### Technical Infrastructure
@.global/system_context/fountain_spec.md
@.global/system_context/pdf_generation.md

**Purpose**: Understand Fountain format and PDF generation tools

### Workflow Automation
@.global/workflow_rules.md

**Purpose**: Master/Staging/Versions sync protocol

## Project-Specific Context

**CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION FOR EACH PROJECT**

### Project Info
- **Title**: [Your Screenplay Title]
- **Subtitle**: [If applicable]
- **Writer**: [Your Name]
- **Genre**: [Family Adventure / Drama / Thriller / etc.]
- **Logline**: [One-sentence story description]
- **Comps**: [Similar films for reference]

### Key Characters
- **[PROTAGONIST NAME]**: [Brief description, arc, motivation]
- **[SUPPORTING]**: [Description]
- **[ANTAGONIST]**: [Description]

### Research Context
@research/character_notes.md
@research/location_reference.md
@research/historical_notes.md

## Master/Staging Sync Protocol

### After Screenplay Edits in Staging:

When user approves changes:
1. Ask: "Update treatment to reflect screenplay changes?"
2. If yes: analyze changes, update treatment beats
3. Ask: "Sync to master and generate PDFs?"
4. If yes: archive current master, copy staging → master, generate PDFs

### After Treatment Edits in Staging:

When treatment is modified:
1. **STOP** - Do not auto-execute
2. **Analyze dependencies**:
   - Character changes → track all references
   - Location changes → check scene headers
   - Plot changes → verify story structure
3. **Present plan**:
   ```
   "Treatment change: [description]
   Affects: [X scenes, Y characters, Z locations]
   Plan: [step-by-step edit list]
   Estimated scope: [number of edits]
   Proceed?"
   ```
4. **Wait for confirmation**
5. **Execute systematically** if approved
6. **Sync to master** when complete

## Screenwriting Standards

### Scene Construction
- Every scene must have: clear intention + formidable obstacle
- Enter late, exit early
- 2-3 line action paragraphs maximum
- Visual storytelling over exposition
- Scenes advance plot AND/OR develop character (ideally both)

### Dialogue
- Character-specific voices
- Subtext over text (what's meant vs. what's said)
- Each line serves 2+ purposes (plot + character, or character + theme)
- Cut unnecessary words ruthlessly
- Read aloud test - does it sound natural?

### Structure
- Follow Save the Cat beats (15 beats at appropriate pages)
- Three-act framework (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution)
- Midpoint at page 55 raises stakes significantly
- All Is Lost at page 75 creates lowest point
- Character transformation visible in Final Image vs Opening Image

### Formatting
- Industry-standard Fountain syntax
- 1 page ≈ 1 minute of screen time
- Scene numbers for tracking: #1#, #2#, etc.
- Proper character name formatting (ALL CAPS)
- Action lines are what's VISIBLE/AUDIBLE on screen

---

## File Operations

### Never Create Unless Requested
- Don't auto-generate documentation
- Don't create helper scripts without asking
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

### Always Verify Before Large Edits
- Present plan for changes affecting 10+ lines
- Ask confirmation for structural changes
- Explain reasoning for significant modifications

### Maintain Dependencies
- Track character name changes throughout
- Update all references when renaming
- Verify scene continuity after edits
- Check plot logic after structural changes

---

## When Stuck or Uncertain

1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Don't guess
2. **Search the codebase** - Patterns might exist
3. **Web search** - Research unfamiliar concepts
4. **Present options** - Give user choices with trade-offs
5. **Explain trade-offs** - Help user make informed decisions
