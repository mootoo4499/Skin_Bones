## Foundation: Intention and Obstacle (Sorkin Principle)

Every scene must have:

1. **Clear Intention**: Character wants something specific, urgent, and visualizable
2. **Formidable Obstacle**: Barriers genuinely difficult to overcome (not resolvable through simple conversation)
3. **Escalating Conflict**: Tension builds within the scene through active pursuit vs. resistance

**Test Strength**: "Press" on both elements. Weak intention? Increase urgency, emotional weight, consequences. Weak obstacle? Add layers, strengthen resistance, raise stakes.

**Application**: Before writing any scene, identify both elements. If either is missing or weak, revise or cut the scene.

## Primary Framework 1: Three-Act Structure

The foundational architecture for feature screenplays (110 pages).

### Act 1: Setup (Pages 1-25)
- **Opening Image** (p.1): Visual snapshot of protagonist's "before" state
- **Establish World**: Status quo, key relationships, what needs fixing
- **Inciting Incident** (p.10-15): Event disrupting equilibrium, launches main conflict
- **Exposition Management**: Weave background into conflicting-goal scenes (no info dumps)
- **Act 1 Break** (p.25): Protagonist commits to journey; point of no return

### Act 2: Confrontation (Pages 25-85)
- **Progressive Complications** (p.25-55): Escalating challenges increasing in difficulty and emotional impact
- **Midpoint** (p.55): Significant reversal/revelation that shifts protagonist's approach; raises stakes
- **Intensification** (p.55-75): External antagonists + internal doubts converge
- **All Is Lost** (p.75): Lowest point; apparent defeat with "whiff of death"
- **Dark Night** (p.75-85): Reflection, despair, confronting core wounds

### Act 3: Resolution (Pages 85-110)
- **New Approach** (p.85): Applies lesson learned; "eureka" moment
- **Climax** (p.90-110): Execute plan demonstrating transformation
- **Resolution Setup**: Tools/skills used in Act 3 must be established earlier
- **Final Image** (p.110): Visual proof of change (contrasts Opening Image)

**Key**: Each act ends with definitive shift propelling into next act.

## Primary Framework 2: Save the Cat Beat Sheet

Use these 15 beats to ensure commercial pacing and emotional satisfaction (page ranges for 110-page script).

### Critical Beats:

1. **Opening Image** (1): Tone and protagonist's initial state
2. **Theme Stated** (5): Someone states the lesson protagonist will learn (subtle, dismissed initially)
3. **Setup** (1-10): "Six things that need fixing" - flaws, relationships, situations
4. **Catalyst** (12): External event forcing protagonist to respond
5. **Debate** (12-25): Hesitation before committing to journey
6. **Break Into Two** (25): Protagonist chooses to enter new situation
7. **B Story** (30): Relationship/mentor carrying thematic message
8. **Fun and Games** (30-55): "Promise of the premise" - deliver what concept offers
9. **Midpoint** (55): Public victory/defeat clarifying true stakes; shifts external to internal goals
10. **Bad Guys Close In** (55-75): External + internal antagonistic forces gain ground
11. **All Is Lost** (75): Lowest point; "whiff of death"
12. **Dark Night of Soul** (75-85): Hopelessness before breakthrough
13. **Break Into Three** (85): Eureka moment applying A + B Story lessons
14. **Finale** (85-110): Execute plan via "gather team," "execute," "high tower surprise," "dig deep"
15. **Final Image** (110): Mirror Opening Image showing transformation

### Genre Categories (emphasize accordingly):

- **Monster in the House**: Confined space + threat + sin (Alien, Jaws)
- **Golden Fleece**: Journey + team + prize (LOTR, Finding Nemo)
- **Out of Bottle**: Wish + consequences + lesson (Big, Groundhog Day)
- **Dude with Problem**: Ordinary person + extraordinary crisis (Die Hard, Hunger Games)
- **Rites of Passage**: Life transition + wrong approach + acceptance (Lady Bird)
- **Buddy Love**: Incomplete hero + counterpart + complication (When Harry Met Sally)
- **Whydunit**: Detective + secret investigation (Chinatown, Gone Girl)
- **Fool Triumphant**: Underdog + establishment + transmutation (Legally Blonde)
- **Institutionalized**: Group + choice + sacrifice (One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest)
- **Superhero**: Special power + nemesis + curse (Batman Begins)

## Secondary Framework: Story Circle (Character-Driven Alternative)

Dan Harmon's 8-stage psychological journey. Use when character transformation is primary focus.

1. **YOU**: Character in comfort zone (establish baseline, hint at incompleteness)
2. **NEED**: Conscious desire or unconscious need driving them (often tension between want vs. need)
3. **GO**: Cross threshold into unfamiliar situation (old rules no longer apply)
4. **SEARCH**: Attempt goal using old methods (escalating failures force growth)
5. **FIND**: Get what they wanted (hollow victory revealing deeper need)
6. **TAKE**: Pay heavy price (loss/sacrifice forcing transformation)
7. **RETURN**: Face original situation with new knowledge
8. **CHANGE**: Demonstrate transformation through action

**Integration with 3-Act**: Stages 1-3 = Act 1; 4-6 = Act 2; 7-8 = Act 3

**When to Use**: Character dramas, psychological narratives, episodic TV (micro-circles per episode, macro per season)

## Supplemental Framework 1: McKee Value Shifts

Robert McKee's scene-by-scene approach for dramatic power.

**Core Beats**:
- **Inciting Incident**: Life-quake knocking protagonist out of equilibrium
- **Progressive Complications**: Forces of antagonism widening gap between expectation and result
- **Crisis**: Dilemma forcing risky moral/strategic choice
- **Climax**: Irreversible value swing answering story question
- **Resolution**: Brief aftermath locking new equilibrium
- **Controlling Idea**: "Value + is won/lost because + Truth" (one sentence)

**Scene Diagnostic**: Every scene must end with a value shift driven by a turning point. Track values scene-by-scene (e.g., Freedom → Hope →+ Despair →). No shift = weak scene.

**Channels of Conflict**: Mix inner (psychological), personal (relationships), and societal (external forces) to deepen stakes.

## Supplemental Framework 2: Arndt/Pixar Six Tent-Poles

Michael Arndt's iterative approach for emotionally cohesive narratives.

**Six Beats**:
1. **Opening/Expectations**: Establish future each protagonist assumes
2. **Inciting Incident**: Visceral event overturning expected future
3. **First-Act Break**: Decision/circumstance locking hero into journey
4. **Midpoint Reversal**: New obstacles flip plan, raise stakes for all subplots
5. **Second-Act Break/Crisis**: External, internal, philosophical stakes collapse simultaneously
6. **Climax/Payoff**: Hero resolves philosophical doubt revealed at crisis

**Key Principles**:
- Plot backwards when stuck: start with hero's worst fear, reverse-engineer beats
- Make themes visceral: express ideas through concrete cinematic jeopardy
- Sync external and internal stakes at every major beat
- Shape antagonist as dark mirror of hero's flaw

## Dialogue Construction

### Process Pipeline:
1. **Voice Pass**: Define each speaker's lexicon, rhythm, attitude
2. **Purpose Pass**: Every exchange reveals character or moves plot; flag filler
3. **Craft Pass**: Stick to "said" + action beats; tighten punctuation; cut adverbs
4. **Subtext Pass**: Clarify what's meant vs. spoken; track power shifts
5. **Read-Aloud Test**: Trim until lines flow like real speech

### Core Principles:
- **Natural Cadence**: Use fragments, contractions, overlaps; avoid perfect grammar
- **Distinct Voices**: Vary vocabulary, rhythm, worldview per character
- **Purpose & Subtext**: Dialogue must reveal or advance; hide motive beneath surface words
- **Musicality**: Write dialogue with rhythm and flow when spoken aloud
- **Economy**: Cut unnecessary words; each line serves 2+ purposes (character + plot, or plot + theme)
- **Exposition Through Conflict**: Embed background in scenes with opposing goals

### Craft Guidelines:
- Begin scenes late, exit early (skip hellos/goodbyes)
- Let characters talk past each other to expose tension
- Silence and beats often speak louder than extra lines
- Default to "said" or concise action beats (avoid adverbial tags)
- Interruptions with em-dash; trailing thoughts with ellipsis

---

## Action Line Writing

### Core Standards:
- **Paragraph Length**: 2-3 lines average; max 4-5 lines per paragraph
- **White Space**: Essential for readability; avoid dense blocks
- **Visual Only**: Describe only what's perceivable on screen (no internal thoughts)
- **Purpose**: Advance story, reveal character, or establish tone
- **Scene Flow**: Avoid full pages of uninterrupted action or dialogue

### Practical Guidelines:
- Write action in short, visual bursts between dialogue
- Use active, evocative verbs
- Action paragraphs should take same time to read as to watch (1 page ≈ 1 minute)
- Break up long dialogue with brief, purposeful action beats
- Enter scenes late, exit early

### Typical Ratio:
- No fixed percentage, but aim for 50%+ action/description
- Dialogue typically 10-25% of screenplay
- Varies by genre (action films more description, dramas more dialogue)

---

## Character Development

### Essential Elements:
- **Active Protagonists**: Drive story through choices (not just reactions)
- **Dimensional Antagonists**: Understandable motivations (not evil for evil's sake)
- **Transformation Arc**: Map specific belief/behavior changes from Opening to Final Image
- **Consistent Psychology**: Decisions follow internal logic even when flawed
- **Specificity**: Create distinctive characters through specific traits, habits, speech patterns

### Show Don't Tell:
- Reveal character through decisions under pressure
- Actions speak louder than self-description
- Establish flaws in Act 1 that are confronted in Act 3
- Character networks create layers of conflict and alliance

---

## Scene Construction

### Structure Every Scene:
1. **Enter Late, Exit Early**: Start after setup, end before resolution
2. **Dramatic Question**: What specific question will this scene answer?
3. **Visual First**: Show before telling; screenplays are visual blueprints
4. **Escalate**: Build tension/stakes/emotion within scene
5. **Cause and Effect**: Each scene results from previous; causes next
6. **Goal-Conflict-Disaster**: Scene structure creating forward momentum

### Scene Test:
Does this scene advance plot OR develop character? Ideally both. If neither, cut it.

## Practical Application for AI Systems

### When Writing New Material:

1. **Identify Beat First**: Which Save the Cat beat or Story Circle stage?
2. **Define Intention/Obstacle**: What does character want? What stops them?
3. **Apply Genre Conventions**: Use appropriate genre category elements
4. **Track Transformation**: How does this scene move character along arc?
5. **McKee Value Check**: What value shifts in this scene?
6. **Visual Emphasis**: Describe action and imagery over interior thought
7. **Dialogue Purpose**: Each line serves 2+ functions with subtext

### When Revising:

1. **Beat Check**: Verify all 15 beats present and emotionally effective
2. **Scene Audit**: Every scene passes intention/obstacle test
3. **Value Shift Analysis**: Each scene ends with changed value
4. **Arc Verification**: Opening Image vs Final Image shows clear transformation
5. **Dialogue Polish**: Cut exposition, strengthen subtext, ensure distinct voices
6. **Pacing**: Reading time matches screen time (1 page ≈ 1 minute)
7. **Action Line Check**: 2-3 line paragraphs, plenty of white space

### Genre-Specific Priorities:

- **Action/Thriller**: Extended Search/Fun and Games; visual action sequences; external conflicts dominate
- **Drama**: Deep Need/Take stages; nuanced character psychology; internal conflicts emphasized
- **Comedy**: TAKE played for irony; exaggerated flaws corrected through embarrassment; timing crucial
- **Horror**: FIND reveals something terrible; heightened dread; subvert CHANGE with negative transformation
- **Romance**: B Story integrated with A Story; TAKE involves vulnerability/intimacy fear; relationship obstacles

## Critical Reminders for AI Systems

1. **Structure Supports, Doesn't Dictate**: Use frameworks as foundation, not formula
2. **Emotional Function Over Page Count**: Beat placement guides, not rules; emotional impact matters most
3. **Always Visual**: Screenplays are production blueprints for what's seen/heard on screen
4. **Economy of Language**: Every word counts; cut ruthlessly
5. **Industry-Standard Formatting**: Non-negotiable; maintains professionalism
6. **Theme Integration**: Weave throughout, especially at Theme Stated, Midpoint, All Is Lost, Final Image
7. **Test Obstacles**: If easily overcome through conversation or minor action, strengthen them
8. **Earned Transformation**: Character change must result from journey, demonstrated through action
9. **Scene Purpose**: Each scene advances plot, develops character, or preferably both
10. **Read Aloud**: Dialogue must sound natural when spoken; rhythm and musicality essential
11. **Value Shifts**: Track changing values scene-by-scene for dramatic power
12. **Controlling Idea**: State central argument as "Value + is won/lost because + Truth"

## Response Framework for AI Systems

When providing feedback or generating content:

1. **Diagnose First**: Identify core story problem before suggesting solutions
2. **Preserve Voice**: Maintain writer's unique style and intention
3. **Prioritize Impact**: Address story-breaking issues before polish notes
4. **Provide Options**: Offer multiple solutions with trade-off explanations
5. **Connect to Emotion**: Link technical fixes to emotional/audience impact
6. **Respect Genre**: Acknowledge when creative choices serve story despite "breaking rules"
7. **Balance Formula and Innovation**: Use beats as foundation while allowing creative variation

---

## Quick Reference Decision Tree

**Scene lacks tension?**
→ Strengthen intention or obstacle

**Beat placement off?**
→ Check emotional function, not just page number

**Character passive?**
→ Give them active choices that drive story forward

**Dialogue exposition-heavy?**
→ Embed in conflict between characters with opposing goals

**Midpoint weak?**
→ Create false victory/defeat that shifts stakes and approach

**Act 2 sags?**
→ Use Arndt's midpoint reversal; flip plan and raise all subplot stakes

**Theme unclear?**
→ State it subtly at p.5; demonstrate throughout; prove in Final Image

**Climax unearned?**
→ Verify all necessary tools/skills established earlier; check transformation arc complete
